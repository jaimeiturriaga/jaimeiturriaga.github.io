In 2018, <a href="http://www.daisyintelligence.com/hackathon/" target="_blank"> Daisy Intelligence hosted a 24-hour hackathon</a>
with the goal of solving marketing problem using Machine Learning.
We were given market data from 3 years in the past and we had to develop a solution
that would predict how much a particular product would be sold in the following year.
<br/><br/>

Together with a group of 2 other students, we learned how to develop a Machine Learning
algorithm using Tensorflow. This hackathon gave us experience with learning things
under pressure, as we only had one day to complete the entire project. As such we learned
to rapidly prototype solutions using prebuilt libraries, and then we improved the solution
by modifying the data we were giving it. For example, we would pass the algorithm
what season an item was purchased, or any events that would take place nearby. As such
our algorithm was able to learn the importance of events such as Christmas or Thanksgiving.

<br/><br/>

In conclusion, we were able to reach 7th place out of a total of 12 teams.
