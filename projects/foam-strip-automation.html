      This was my capstone project for my study at the University of Toronto.
      The goal of this project was to design and prototype an automation method
      for Comtek Advanced Structure's production of foam strips. These foam strips
      need to be of a certain length, and they require holes of various sizes and at
      various locations. <br/> <br/>

      This project was worked on over the course of 7 months, during which myself along
      with a group of 4 other students designed and developed the physical prototype
      for this method.
