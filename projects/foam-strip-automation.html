      This was my capstone project for my study at the University of Toronto.
      The goal of this project was to design and prototype an automation method
      for Comtek Advanced Structure's production of foam strips. These foam strips
      need to be of a certain length, and they require holes of various sizes and at
      various locations. <br/> <br/>

      This project was worked on over the course of 7 months, during which myself along
      with a group of 4 other students designed and developed the physical prototype
      for this method. <br/> <br/>

      I worked on developing the software components of the project. Along with one
      other student, we developed the software to convert Comtek's existing 2D cad files
      into files that the automation tool can use. Additionally, we developed the
      PLC code that drives the mechanical system.

The challenge of the project came with working with completely unfamiliar systems.
Prior to working on this project, we had no experience when it came to working with PLCs
and the various mechanical components. There wasn't a large amount of documentation to help
us, especially for the PLC, so we overcame this using careful testing with trial
and error.

    For the converter, we developed it using an iterative approach. We first developed
    a basic solution to the problem. We then developed a way of verifying the solution.
    Afterwards, we would test our current solution, locate problems areas with the solution,
    and then either fix those areas, or redesign the solution from the ground up.
    <br/><br/>

    We found great success using this testing driven approach. Since the 2D cad files
    didn't follow a particular standard, we could use this rapid prototyping to quickly
    pin down test cases that would cause problems with our design. <br/></br>
