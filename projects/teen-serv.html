      This was the project for CSC444 Computer Engineering. Along with a group of
      6 other students, we developed a <a href="https://teen-serv.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">website</a> that
      allows teenagers to apply for simple neighborhood jobs. These jobs may include
      mowing the lawn or babysitting. The purpose of this project was to apply our
      knowledge of programming using the structured AGILE methodology.

Over the course of the 4 months I worked on this, I learned about how to split
up difficult programming tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks. These features
would only take a few days to complete, and would only be committed once completed.
By splitting up problems into smaller problems, the code was much easier to debug, as
we could write tests for each small feature and pinpoint where along the pipeline
the problem came from.

</br></br>
As a result of this course, the AGILE methodology became my preferred method of developing
software as it allows for frequent testing while having multiple people working on different
parts of the program simultaneously.
